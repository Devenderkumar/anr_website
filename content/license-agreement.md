**1. Data; Limited License.** Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Applied Nonprofit Research (DBA “990 Consulting”) will provide Licensee with the data described in the applicable Order Form (the “Data”). All Data shall be provided in the form and manner set forth in the applicable Order Form and shall be subject to any requirements set forth therein. Subject to Licensee’s compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Applied Nonprofit Research hereby grants to Licensee a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable license to use the Data solely for the purpose described on the applicable Order Form (the “Purpose”), and for no other use or purpose. Licensee hereby acknowledges that any use by Licensee of the Applied Nonprofit Research platform located at appliednonprofitresearch.com, 990consulting.com, and/or any subdomain of the preceding (the “Platform”) shall be governed not by the terms of this Agreement, but shall be governed solely by the Applied Nonprofit Research Terms of Service (www.appliednonprofitresearch.com/terms-of-service/) and Applied Nonprofit Research Privacy Policy (www.appliednonprofitresearch.com/privacy-policy/) (collectively, the “Terms of Service”). Licensee represents and warrants that the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement does not and will not conflict with any agreement, instrument, judgment, law, rule or regulation or understanding, oral or written, to which it is a party or by which it may be bound or subject.  “Order Form” means the mutually agreed upon order forms for Data agreed to by authorized representatives of both parties, each of which will incorporate the terms and conditions and deemed to be a part of this Agreement.


**2. Restrictions.** Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, Licensee shall not (and shall not permit any third party to), directly or indirectly: (i) modify, translate, or create derivative works based on the Data except as described in the Purpose; (ii) download, copy, rent, lease, distribute, pledge, assign, sell, license or otherwise transfer or encumber rights to or make available to any third party the Data (including without limitation for the purpose of the third party distributing or publishing the Data); (iii) use the Data for the benefit of a third party or for any purpose other than the Purpose; (iv) remove or otherwise alter any proprietary notices or labels from the Data or any portion thereof; (v) use the Data to build an application or product that is competitive with any product or service of Applied Nonprofit Research or Open990.org, Inc. (vi) use or provide the Data as part of any service bureau, time sharing, software as a service or other similar means, or (vii) use the Data in any unlawful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, libelous, deceptive, fraudulent, invasive of another’s privacy, tortious or otherwise unlawful manner.  Licensee is responsible for all of Licensee’s activity in connection with the Data and shall be solely responsible for any breach of obligations in this Agreement by its employees, contractors and agents. Licensee (a) shall use the Data in compliance with all applicable local, state, national and foreign laws, treaties and regulations in connection with Licensee’s use of the Data (including those related to data privacy, international communications, export laws and the transmission of technical or personal data laws), and (b) shall not use the Data in a manner that violates any third party intellectual property, contractual or other proprietary rights. Additionally, Licensee shall not bypass any measures Applied Nonprofit Research may use to prevent or restrict access to the Data (or other accounts, computer systems or networks connected to the Data). Licensee expressly acknowledges that any breach of this Section 2 shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement, triggering Applied Nonprofit Research’s immediate right to terminate and Licensee’s obligation to immediately return or destroy the Data, as set forth in Section 5 below. In no event shall Applied Nonprofit Research be liable for any data loss, lost profits or cost of procurement of substitute goods or services resulting from such return or destruction of the Data.


**3. Ownership; Feedback.** As between the parties, Applied Nonprofit Research and its licensors retain all right, title, and interest in and to the Data, and all software, data, products, works, analyses and other intellectual property and moral rights related thereto or created, used, or provided by Applied Nonprofit Research for the purposes of this Agreement. No rights or licenses are granted except as expressly and unambiguously set forth in this Agreement. Licensee may from time to time provide suggestions, comments or other feedback to Applied Nonprofit Research with respect to the Data (“Feedback”). Licensee shall, and hereby does, assign to Applied Nonprofit Research all right, title and interest (including all related intellectual property and other proprietary rights) in and to the Feedback.


**4. Fees; Payments and Billing.**

i. Licensee shall pay fees to Applied Nonprofit Research in accordance with and on the schedule and terms specified in the applicable Order Form (the “Fees”). Licensee shall be responsible for any taxes, duties, withholdings or other governmental assessments that may apply to the payments hereunder.  For the avoidance of doubt, nonpayment of any invoice (in whole or in part) shall be considered a material breach of this Agreement.  All Fees are due in USD, exclusive of (a) sales, excise and similar taxes and (b) returns, refunds, allowances, discounts and adjustments.

ii. Applied Nonprofit Research may use a third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) to bill Licensee for the Fees.  The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to this Agreement and the Terms of Service.  Applied Nonprofit Research is not responsible for any error by the Payment Processor.  By entering into an Order Form, Licensee agrees to pay Applied Nonprofit Research, through the Payment Processor, all Fees for the Data as set forth in such Order Form in accordance with the applicable payment terms, and Licensee authorizes Applied Nonprofit Research, through the Payment Processor, to charge Licensee’s chosen payment provider (the “Payment Method”).  Licensee agrees to make payment using that selected Payment Method.  Applied Nonprofit Research reserves the right to correct any errors or mistakes.  The terms of Licensee’s payment will be based on Licensee’s Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between Licensee and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of Licensee’s chosen Payment Method.  If Applied Nonprofit Research, through the Payment Processor, does not receive payment from Licensee, Licensee agrees to pay all amounts due upon demand.  Licensee shall provide current, complete and accurate information for Licensee’s billing account, shall promptly update all information to keep such billing account current, complete and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card number, or credit card expiration date), and shall promptly notify Applied Nonprofit Research or the Payment Processor if Licensee’s Payment Method is cancelled (e.g., for loss or theft).  If Licensee fails to provide any of the foregoing information, Licensee agrees that Applied Nonprofit Research may continue charging Licensee for any use of the Data under the billing account unless the applicable Order Form has been terminated or expired, as applicable.

iii. If Licensee has chosen to license Data hereunder under a renewal model (“Data Renewal”), Licensee acknowledges that there will be a one-time charge followed by recurring period charges as agreed to by Licensee.  By choosing a Data Renewal, Licensee acknowledges that the license to the Data has an initial and recurring payment feature and Licensee accepts responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation or other termination of the renewal.  APPLIED NONPROFIT RESEARCH MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM LICENSEE, UNTIL LICENSEE PROVIDES PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY Applied Nonprofit Research) THAT LICENSEE HAS TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISHES TO CHANGE LICENSEE’S PAYMENT METHOD.  SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE Applied Nonprofit Research REASONABLY COULD ACT. Unless Licensee opts out of auto-renewal, any Data Renewal Licensee has signed up for will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods as set forth in the Order Form.  If Licensee terminates a Data Renewal, Licensee will not receive any further updates to the Data.  Licensee will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the fees except as set forth in Section 5 below.

iv. Licensee’s non-termination of this Agreement or the Data Renewal reaffirms that Applied Nonprofit Research is authorized to charge Licensee’s Payment Method for the Data.  Applied Nonprofit Research may submit those charges for payment and Licensee will be responsible for such charges.  Nothing herein waives Applied Nonprofit Research’s right to seek payment directly from Licensee.


**5. Term; Termination.** The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue until terminated as provided herein. Applied Nonprofit Research may terminate this Agreement immediately if Licensee materially breaches this Agreement, in which case the license granted in Section 1 shall immediately expire and Licensee shall cease all use of the Data, and shall promptly delete or destroy all copies of the Data, and all analyses, compilations, derivatives or other documents or materials that contain or reflect the Data, in Licensee’s possession or control.  Sections 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.


**6. Confidentiality.** During the term of this Agreement, Applied Nonprofit Research may provide Licensee with confidential and/or proprietary materials and information (“Confidential Information”). All materials and information provided by Applied Nonprofit Research to Licensee and identified at the time of disclosure as “Confidential” or bearing a similar legend, and all other information that the Licensee reasonably should have known was the Confidential Information of Applied Nonprofit Research, shall be considered Confidential Information.   In addition, the pricing terms under any Order Form (including all discussions between the parties related thereto) are Confidential Information of Applied Nonprofit Research.  Licensee shall maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information and will not disclose such information to any third party without the prior written consent of Applied Nonprofit Research, except as permitted herein. Except as permitted herein, Licensee will only use the Confidential Information internally for the purposes contemplated hereunder. The obligations in this Section 6 shall not apply to any information that (i) is made generally available to the public without breach of this Agreement, (ii) is developed by the Licensee independently from the Confidential Information, (iii) is disclosed to Licensee by a third party without restriction, or (iv) was in the Licensee’s lawful possession prior to the disclosure and was not obtained by the Licensee either directly or indirectly from Applied Nonprofit Research. At any time, upon Applied Nonprofit Research’s request, Licensee shall return to Applied Nonprofit Research all Applied Nonprofit Research’s Confidential Information in its possession, including, without limitation, all copies and extracts thereof. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that any breach or threatened breach of this Section 6 will cause irreparable harm to Applied Nonprofit Research for which money damages will not be an adequate remedy. Therefore, Applied Nonprofit Research shall, in addition to any other legal or equitable remedies, be entitled to an injunction or similar equitable relief against any such breach or threatened breach without the necessity of posting any bond.


**7. Disclaimer.** THE DATA IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” AND IS WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES IMPLIED BY ANY COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, USAGE OF TRADE, OR COURSE OF DEALING, ALL OF WHICH ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED. APPLIED NONPROFIT RESEARCH DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE DATA WILL BE UPDATED.  APPLIED NONPROFIT RESEARCH SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM ANY USE OF THE DATA, FROM ERRORS, OMISSIONS OR OTHERWISE.


**8. Limitation of Liability.** IN NO EVENT SHALL APPLIED NONPROFIT RESEARCH, NOR ITS DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, PARTNERS, SUPPLIERS OR CONTENT PROVIDERS, BE LIABLE UNDER CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, NEGLIGENCE OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY WITH RESPECT TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT (I) FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, DATA LOSS, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES (HOWEVER ARISING), (II) FOR ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE (REGARDLESS OF THE SOURCE OF ORIGINATION), OR (III) FOR ANY DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF ALL FEES PAID OR PAYABLE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE DATE THE APPLICABLE CLAIM AROSE (IN THE AGGREGATE).


**9. Indemnification.** Licensee will indemnify, defend and hold Applied Nonprofit Research, its affiliates, licensors and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents harmless from any and all claims, demands, actions, losses, liabilities, costs, expenses and damages of any kind or nature (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees) to the extent arising out of or related to (i) any breach of its representations, warranties, covenants or obligations under this Agreement, and (ii) any act or omission by Licensee in using the Data. Applied Nonprofit Research shall have the right to participate in the defense of any such claim at its own expense, and such participation by Applied Nonprofit Research will not relieve Licensee of its indemnification obligations under this Section 9.


**10. Not a predictive model.** The parties acknowledge and agree that Data is not intended to model, predict, forecast, cast judgment upon, or provide advice of any kind concerning any event or outcome, whether past or present, including but not limited to financial outcomes and risks of loss. The Licensee assumes all responsibility for the interpretation of any information provided by Applied Nonprofit Research.

**11. Counterparts; Electronic Signature.** This Agreement may be electronically signed in any number of counterparts with the same effect as if the signature on each such counterpart were upon the same instrument, and a facsimile transmission or electronic delivery of an electronic signature shall be deemed to be an original signature. By checking the box stating “I have read and accept the License Agreement” during the checkout process, the Licensee acknowledges to electronically signing this Agreement and accepting its terms and conditions.


**12. Miscellaneous.** This Agreement represents the entire agreement between Licensee and Applied Nonprofit Research with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between Licensee and Applied Nonprofit Research with respect thereto. The Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, USA, excluding its conflicts of law rules, and the parties’ consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts located in New York, New York, USA. This Agreement may be amended or waived only by a writing executed by both parties. Licensee may not assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder without Applied Nonprofit Research’s consent. Applied Nonprofit Research may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights and obligations hereunder without consent. For all purposes of this Agreement each party shall be and act as an independent contractor and not as partner, joint venture, or agent of the other and shall not bind, nor attempt to bind, the other to any contract. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to restrict Applied Nonprofit Research from entering into any other similar arrangements with third parties. The failure of either party to act with respect to a breach of this Agreement by the other party shall not constitute a waiver and shall not limit such party’s rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches. In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. All notices under this Agreement shall be in writing, and shall be deemed given when personally delivered, when sent by confirmed email, or seven (7) days after being sent by registered mail to the address of the party to be noticed as set forth herein or such other address as such party last provided to the other by written notice.
